Annie=
Great work, the garden is 24 across and I am halfway along. So using the 12 rod is exactly right. Thank you for saving me.=
No problem!=
Annie=
You saved me! However, you made up a half out of multiple fractions. I can show you a more optimum way. =

Help me! You can only rescue me if you use the right amount of rods to get to this platform, otherwise I can't get back safely. If you need to start again talk to the Prof.=

Dean of Students=
Welcome! We need your help with three different maths challenges. Pick one below, then a Professor from that school will guide you from the courtyard ahead.=
Fraction=
Ratios=
Scale Factors=
Guild Master=
This old building desperately needs some new windows. The architecture team needs the help of a Mathmogician to scale it correctly. Follow me!=
Okay=
Guild Master=
Keep up, keep up.=
Sorry! =
Guild Master=
Take this stained glass and make a design using the smaller frames here. Once your design is ready, click the numerator to increase the amount the window needs to be scaled. Then right click the fraction bar to scale the window. If it fits perfectly you can move on to the next one.=
Will do=
Professor of Alchemy=
I need your help! I am so hungry, but clumsy me managed to drop my lunch money down the well. Please follow me and use maths to get my money back!=
Let's Go!=
Professor of Alchemy=
Please hurry, I’m so hungry.=
On the way!=
Professor of Alchemy=
The well is very dark and deep, you will need to make potions to see and breathe long enough to get my money back. Use the ratios on the walls to make two of the correct potions. Use the ingredients I am giving you and throw them in the hopper, then left click with the wand to make the potions. Be careful, if you get the wrong ratios there may be... side effects. Hint: If the potions you have made do not last long enough, you need to increase the ingredients. But remember as you add to make sure the ratios are still correct! We can't afford any more accidents, not on my watch.=
Okay=
Professor of Cartography=
This is embarrassing, I’ve lost my cartography students in the walled gardens (yes I know). Please help me! Follow me to the gardens.=
Let's Go!=
Professor of Cartography=
Oh dear oh dear, please keep up I cannot lose a whole class.=
Sorry! =
Professor of Cartography=
I need you to rescue each student that is trapped. But you CANNOT touch the grass or the groundskeeper will get very angry. Use these magical rods to reach each student. You need to work out the fractions to get to the area correctly. If you make a mistake or touch the grass head back to me to start again. You can use the numbers on the walls to work out how far each student is, and therefore which rod to use! =
Wish me luck=
Grumpy Groundskeeper=
Grrrrofffff me grass=
Sorry! =
