Welcome! We need your help with three different maths challenges. Pick one below, then a Professor from that school will guide you from the courtyard ahead.=
Fractions=
Ratios=
Scale Factors=
Guild Master=
This old building desperately needs some new windows. The architecture team needs the help of a Mathmogician to scale it correctly. Follow me!=
Okay=
Guild Master=
Keep up, keep up.=
Sorry! =
Guild Master=
The design has already been done, but I need your help to scale it. 

Click on the numerator (top number) to change the scale size. You can count the number of blocks in the frame to work it out. 

Then click on the orb of scaling to my right, to scale the window.=
Will do=
Guild Master=
How can I help?=
More glass =
I’m stuck. =
Guild Master=
1. Place the stained glass in the frames. 
2. Left click the numerator (top number) with the wand to change it.
3. Right click the fraction bar to make the window appear. 
4. If you’ve made a mistake left click the fraction bar to make it disappear.=
Thank you=
Guild Master=
That window fits beautifully! Do you want to keep it and move on or redesign it?=
Carry on.=
Redesign it.=
Guild Master=
Oh my goodness, that’s too big! Try again. =
Okay=
Guild Master=
I need it to fill the frame. Make it bigger.=
Okay.=
Guild Master=
Impressive work, if you are finished let’s take a tour of what you have created. =
Let’s Go.=
Guild Master=
You’ve done really well to reach this point. The next challenges are much harder so you can graduate now if you want. =
Carry on.=
Graduate.=
Guild Master=
You are true artisan, it’s time to graduate with full honours.=
Graduate=
Guild Master=
Brrrrr I can feel the breeze already, make sure the window is full of glass.=
Okay=
Guild Master=
We’re working in blocks here, that scale factor isn’t a whole number. 

Try again but make it a whole number.=
On it!=
Professor of Alchemy=
I hear you want to take on the Well diving championship, very well, follow me. =
Let's Go=
Professor of Alchemy=
The challenge awaits, please keep up.=
On the way!=
Professor of Alchemy=
Mmmm delicious, okay lets get some coins.

The ratios for the potions you’ll need are on the wall. 

To make a potion mix it in the cauldron and tap it with your wand.=
Okay let’s go.=
Professor of Alchemy=
How can I help?=
More ingredients=
I’m stuck. =
Professor of Alchemy=
Here are the steps for the game. 
1. Check the ratios on the wall.
2. Chuck the ingredients in the cauldron to the correct ratio.
3. Click on the cauldron with your wand.
4. Check the bar chart to see if your ratios are correct. 
5. If they are correct, drink the potion and dive in the well. 
6. Remember to follow the rules and click on the coins to gather them. =
Thank you=
Professor of Alchemy=
You broke rule number 2, you must let the potions do the work, no swimming or diving.=
Sorry! =
Professor of Alchemy=
Before we start I need you to make me a .... I mean teach you about ratios, by making me chocolate milk. 

Put 2 parts Cocoa beans to 1 part Milk into the cauldron and tap it with your wand.=
On it!=
Professor of Alchemy=
Eurghhhh that is not right, 

You need to put 2 parts cocoa to 1 part milk. 
=
On it!=
Professor of Cartography=
This is embarrassing, I’ve lost my cartography students in the walled gardens (yes I know). Please help me! Follow me to the gardens.=
Let's Go!=
Professor of Cartography=
Oh dear oh dear, please keep up I cannot lose a whole class.=
Sorry! =
Professor of Cartography=
I need you to rescue each student that is trapped.  Use these magical rods to reach each student. 

If you need to start again or get stuck come back to me!=
Wish me luck=
Professor of Cartography=
How can I help?=
Help!=
Start Again.=
Professor of Cartography=
1. There are three grids two are  24x24 blocks wide and one is 48 x24 you need to use the rods to cross them.
2. You can place the rods by right clicking in front of the white blocks. 
3. Talk to each student as you go, they will let you know if you have placed the most optimum rod down. =
Thank you=
Professor of Cartography=
Well done you saved the student and made it to a checkpoint. Come back to me if you run out of rods.=
Okay=
More Rods.=
Professor of Cartography =
Getting more rods will reset the game. 

Are you sure you want to reset the game?=
No thanks=
Reset the game. =
