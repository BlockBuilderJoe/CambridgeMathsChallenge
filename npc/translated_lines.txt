Great work, the garden is 24 across and I am halfway along. So using the 12 rod is exactly right. Thank you for saving me.=
No problem!=
Annie=
You saved me! However, you made up a half out of multiple fractions. I can show you a more optimum way. =

Annie=
Help me! You can only rescue me if you use the right amount of rods to get to this platform, otherwise I can't get back safely. If you need to start again talk to the Prof.=
Okay=

Dean of Students=
Welcome! We need your help with three different maths challenges. Pick one below, then a Professor from that school will guide you from the courtyard ahead.=
Fractions=
Ratios=
Scale Factors=
Guild Master=
This old building desperately needs some new windows. The architecture team needs the help of a Mathmogician to scale it correctly. Follow me!=
Okay=
Guild Master=
Keep up, keep up.=
Sorry! =
Guild Master=
Take this stained glass and make a design using the smaller frames here. 

Once your design is ready, click the numerator to increase the amount the window needs to be scaled. 

Then right click the fraction bar to scale the window.=
Will do=
Guild Master=
How can I help?=
More glass =
I’m stuck. =
Guild Master=
1. Place the stained glass in the frames. 
2. Left click the numerator (top number) with the wand to change it.
3. Right click the fraction bar to make the window appear. 
4. If you’ve made a mistake left click the fraction bar to make it disappear.=
Thank you=
Professor of Alchemy=
I hear you want to take on the Well diving championship, very well, follow me. =
Let's Go=
Professor of Alchemy=
The challenge awaits, please keep up.=
On the way!=
Professor of Alchemy=
Mmmm delicious, okay lets get some coins.

The ratios for the potions you’ll need are on the wall. 

To make a potion mix it in the cauldron and tap it with your wand.=
Okay let’s go.=
Professor of Alchemy=
How can I help?=
More ingredients=
I’m stuck. =
Professor of Alchemy=
Here are the steps for the game. 
1. Check the ratios on the wall.
2. Chuck the ingredients in the cauldron to the correct ratio.
3. Click on the cauldron with your wand.
4. Check the bar chart to see if your ratios are correct. 
5. If they are correct, drink the potion and dive in the well. 
6. Remember to follow the rules and click on the coins to gather them. =
Thank you=
Professor of Alchemy=
You broke rule number 2, you must let the potions do the work, no swimming or diving.=
Sorry! =
Professor of Alchemy=
Before we start I need you to make me a .... I mean teach you about ratios, by making me chocolate milk. 

Put 2 parts Cocoa beans to 1 part Milk into the cauldron and tap it with your wand.=
On it!=
Professor of Alchemy=
Eurghhhh that is not right, 

You need to put 2 parts cocoa to 1 part milk. 
=
On it!=
Professor of Cartography=
This is embarrassing, I’ve lost my cartography students in the walled gardens (yes I know). Please help me! Follow me to the gardens.=
Let's Go!=
Professor of Cartography=
Oh dear oh dear, please keep up I cannot lose a whole class.=
Sorry! =
Professor of Cartography=
I need you to rescue each student that is trapped.  Use these magical rods to reach each student. 

If you need to start again or get stuck come back to me!=
Wish me luck=
Professor of Cartography=
How can I help?=
Help!=
Start Again.=
Professor of Cartography=
1. The grids are 24x24 blocks wide and you need to use the rods to cross them.
2. You can place the rods by right clicking in front of the white blocks. 
3. Talk to each student as you go, they will let you know if you have placed the most optimum rod down. =
Thank you=
Professor of Cartography=
Well done you saved the student and made it to a checkpoint. Come back to me if you run out of rods.=
Okay=
More Rods.=
Professor of Cartography =
Getting more rods will reset the game. 

Are you sure you want to reset the game?=
No thanks=
Reset the game. =
